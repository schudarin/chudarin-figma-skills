# chudarin-figma-skills

Agents can write into Figma now. Left to themselves they design badly and break the file quietly —
a variable that never bound, a component set that deleted itself when its last variant moved out, a
screen assembled from hardcoded values that looks right until someone switches the theme.

This is what fixed that on real product files. Five skills: the process for each stage of design
work, plus 377 recorded Plugin API failures with the way around each one. Every rule here is a case
that broke exactly this way, not a reading of the docs.

[Русская версия](README.ru.md)

## Who it's for

Designers. You install it once, then work in a chat: paste a Figma link, say what you need in one
sentence. No code, no code editor, no plugin to build.

What that looks like in practice — you paste a link to a frame and write "design a settings screen
for this app". In a project it hasn't seen, the agent first looks for the answers it needs — a design
system document, existing screens, the variables already in the file — and asks you only what the
search didn't turn up, at most two questions. It writes that down and never asks again. Then it works
from your components and variables, reads back every binding it set instead of assuming it applied,
and shows you the result. You change one element, it changes that element — not the screen around it.

## The five skills

| Skill | You type something like | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `figma-plan-user-flows` | "What screens do we need for checkout?" | You get every screen and state, entry and exit points, and a page structure for the Figma file — before anything is drawn |
| `figma-audit-design-system` | "Go through this file and tell me what the design system holds" | The agent reads the file and reports components, tokens, patterns and design debt, and writes documentation pages if you ask. Read-only otherwise |
| `figma-design-screens` | "Design a settings screen" · "Change the header on this frame" | The design process itself: where the style comes from, a brief per screen, checks afterwards, edits to approved work one element at a time |
| `figma-plugin-api-rules` | nothing — it loads on its own | 377 real Plugin API failures and the way around each one. Loads before the agent writes anything into your file |
| `figma-fix-variable-bindings` | "Variables on this page are detached, fix them" | Finds detached, orphaned and hardcoded values, shows you a report, and rebinds only after you approve it |

Five `SKILL.md` files and 38 topic files behind them. Eleven of those are the Plugin API pack —
components and variants, instances, layout and geometry, text and fonts, variables and modes,
connectors, annotations, publishing hygiene, FigJam, the tool layer, building a screen from code. The
other twenty-seven carry the audit checklists, the per-screen briefs, the checks that run afterwards,
and 140 UX rules routed by what the screen contains. All plain Markdown. Nothing runs on your
machine, nothing phones home.

## Why it's not just prompting

Most of what goes wrong between an agent and Figma is silent. The call returns success, the file
looks plausible, the binding was never applied. `setBoundVariable('cornerRadius', v)` binds four
per-corner fields and the aggregate key you checked stays empty. A licensed font missing from the
sandbox makes text writes fail in ways that read as your mistake. An instance's `children` omits
hidden descendants, so the inventory you built from it is wrong.

None of that is fixed by asking nicely. It's fixed by knowing the case and checking the result —
which is what these files carry.

## Install

Three things to have first, then two commands.

### 1. A Figma seat that allows agent access

Figma limits an agent by seat, not by skill:

- **Starter plan, or a View or Collab seat on a paid plan** — up to 6 tool calls per month. Enough
  to look at the thing once, not to work.
- **Dev or Full seat on Professional, Organization or Enterprise** — per-minute limits, same as
  Figma's REST API. This is the seat you need.

Writing into a file is free while Figma's beta lasts. Reading counts against the limits above.

### 2. Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's agent. It runs in Terminal — the black window, not a code editor.

Open Terminal (⌘ + Space, type `Terminal`, Enter), paste this and press Enter:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

When it finishes, type `claude` and press Enter — that starts the chat. `/exit` closes it.
Full instructions: [docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup).

### 3. The connection to Figma

Figma publishes its own plugin for Claude Code. It carries the connection (the MCP server) and
Figma's own agent instructions, which these skills build on top of:

```bash
claude plugin install figma@claude-plugins-official
```

Quit Claude Code and start it again. Then type `/mcp` in the chat, pick `figma`, and follow the
login prompt — Figma opens in your browser and asks you to authorize the connection once.

### 4. These skills

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add schudarin/chudarin-figma-skills
claude plugin install chudarin@chudarin
```

Quit Claude Code and start it again. Both commands also work inside the chat as
`/plugin marketplace add …` and `/plugin install …`.

Check it landed:

```bash
claude plugin details chudarin@chudarin
```

Five skills in the list. Inside a chat they're `chudarin:figma-design-screens`,
`chudarin:figma-plugin-api-rules`, and so on — the agent picks them up by itself when the task
matches, and you can name one directly.

## Where to run it

Make one folder per product and always start Claude Code from that folder:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Design/my-product
cd ~/Design/my-product
claude
```

The folder matters. `figma-design-screens` writes what it learned about your project —
design system, style source, the Figma file — into `.claude/design.md` inside it, and every later
session reads that instead of asking you again. Start from a different folder and you start from
zero.

## Your first task

1. In Figma, right-click the frame or page you want → **Copy link to selection**.
2. In Terminal: `cd ~/Design/my-product`, then `claude`.
3. Paste the link, add one sentence.

```
https://figma.com/design/…  — audit this page and tell me what the design system holds
```

```
https://figma.com/design/…  — plan the screens for password recovery
```

```
https://figma.com/design/…  — the padding on these cards is hardcoded, put it back on variables
```

Always paste a link. Without one the agent guesses which file and page you mean, and it guesses
wrong.

## Which skill when

- "What screens do we need for this feature?" → `figma-plan-user-flows`
- "What's in this design system, where is the debt, document it" → `figma-audit-design-system`
- "Design / change / rebuild this screen" → `figma-design-screens`, which pulls in
  `figma-plugin-api-rules` by itself
- Anything that writes to Figma → `figma-plugin-api-rules`
- "Variables are detached / hardcoded / Figma says «Variable was deleted»" → `figma-fix-variable-bindings`

## Update and remove

```bash
claude plugin update chudarin@chudarin      # newest version, restart to apply
claude plugin uninstall chudarin@chudarin   # remove
claude plugin list                          # what is installed right now
```

## When it doesn't work

| What you see | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| The agent says it can't reach Figma | The connection isn't authorized | Type `/mcp`, pick `figma`, log in through the browser |
| It stops after a handful of reads | Seat limit — 6 calls a month on Starter, View or Collab | Ask for a Dev or Full seat on a paid plan |
| Reads start failing later in the day | Figma's rate limit for the account. On a Professional plan expect roughly 70–100 read calls a day across all tools, reset at 00:00 UTC | Continue tomorrow, or split the work across days |
| The agent works in the wrong file or page | It had no link and guessed | Paste the link every time. Also install an "ask before acting" skill — see below |
| The skills don't show up | The plugin is installed but the session is the old one | Quit Claude Code and start it again |
| The agent changed something you didn't want | Figma keeps the file's history | **File → Show version history**, restore the earlier version |

## Recommended alongside

**Nothing in this section is required.** The five skills work installed on their own — the only hard
requirement is the Figma plugin from step 3. What follows makes the runs better, and every piece of
it is someone else's skill, not mine.

These skills decide *how* to work in Figma once the task is clear. They don't decide *what* the task
is. The best runs pair them with a skill that stops the agent before the first action and asks which
project and which Figma file — with Claude Code that's Anthropic's `superpowers`
(`claude plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official`), where `brainstorming` fires on "add a
button", asks for the file link, and only then hands over. Any equivalent works. Without one, expect
the agent to start on the wrong page.

`figma-design-screens` also uses one visual skill per task — a mobile-UI, web, motion or charts
skill, whichever matches the screen. It requires none of them. It reads the list of skills your
session actually has, loads the one matching the task type, and on an empty shelf says so and works
from your design system, your existing screens and its own copy-and-control rules instead. The
names it looks for: `mobile-app-ui-design`, `frontend-design`, `impeccable`,
`design-motion-principles`, `emil-design-eng`, `dataviz`, and `design-critique` for the review
pass.

One of them is Anthropic's own:

```bash
claude plugin install frontend-design@claude-plugins-official
```

The rest are third-party; the catalogues are [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) and
[agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io). Read the licence before installing someone else's work,
and don't worry if a name here has since moved or gone: the skill checks the shelf at run time
rather than trusting this list, so a retired name costs nothing.

Also worth having: a writing skill of your own for button labels and interface text. These skills
place the text, they don't write it.

## Other agents, and installing by hand

<details>
<summary>Codex, or Claude Code without the plugin system</summary>

Every skill is a folder: `SKILL.md` + `references/` + `agents/openai.yaml` for Codex. Clone the
repository and link the folders where your agent looks for skills.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schudarin/chudarin-figma-skills ~/chudarin-figma-skills
```

**Claude Code** — `~/.claude/skills/` for every project, or `<project>/.claude/skills/` for one:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
for s in ~/chudarin-figma-skills/skills/*; do ln -sfn "$s" ~/.claude/skills/; done
```

**Codex** — `~/.agents/skills/` for every project, or `<repo>/.agents/skills/` for one. Call a skill
explicitly with `$skill-name`; implicit invocation is enabled on all five.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
for s in ~/chudarin-figma-skills/skills/*; do ln -sfn "$s" ~/.agents/skills/; done
```

Re-run the loop after `git pull` to pick up updates.

On any other agent this is ordinary Markdown — hand `SKILL.md` to the agent as a context file before
Figma work.

Either way you still need the Figma MCP server, and Figma's own `figma-use` instructions loaded
before the first `use_figma` call: the Figma plugin provides them in Claude Code, elsewhere the MCP
resource `skill://figma/figma-use/SKILL.md` does.

## Contributing

Each skill documents how to extend it; for `figma-plugin-api-rules` the protocol is at the end of
its [`SKILL.md`](skills/figma-plugin-api-rules/SKILL.md). Facts about one specific Figma file — node
IDs, local conventions — don't belong here. Keep those in `<project>/.claude/design.md` or your own
notes.
