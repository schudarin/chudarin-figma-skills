# figma-plugin-api-rules

378 ways the Figma Plugin API breaks when an agent drives it, and what to do instead. Every entry
is a real case that failed exactly this way, written as Principle / Symptom / Pattern — not a
rewrite of the docs.

It exists because most of these failures are silent: the call returns success, the file looks
plausible, and the binding was never applied. The rules say what to check.

## Do I need to do anything?

**If you installed the `chudarin` plugin, no.** The skill is already there, and the agent loads it
by itself before writing to a Figma file. Installation is in the
[repository README](../../README.md). Stop here.

The rest of this page is for two cases: you want the pack without the plugin system, or you want to
add a rule to it.

## What's inside

- `SKILL.md` — hard rules, the universal principles that keep recurring, a routing table by topic, a
  quick-scan table of common mistakes, and the protocol for adding to the pack.
- `references/*.md` — pitfalls by topic: components and variants, instances, layout and geometry,
  text and fonts, variables and modes, connectors, annotations, publishing hygiene, FigJam, the MCP
  tool layer, and building a screen from code.

## Using it without the plugin

The folder is a standard agent skill. Put it where your agent looks for skills:

- **Claude Code** — `~/.claude/skills/figma-plugin-api-rules/` for every project, or
  `<project>/.claude/skills/figma-plugin-api-rules/` for one.
- **Codex** — `~/.agents/skills/figma-plugin-api-rules/` or `<repo>/.agents/skills/`. Call it
  explicitly with `$figma-plugin-api-rules`; implicit invocation is on.
- **Any other agent** — it's plain Markdown. Hand `SKILL.md` to the agent as a context file before
  Figma work.

Load `SKILL.md` before the first programmatic Figma call in a session, on top of your tool's own
instructions for calling the API — `figma-use` in Claude Code, the MCP resource
`skill://figma/figma-use/SKILL.md` elsewhere. This pack adds to those; it never replaces them.
The topic files load on demand, by the routing table inside `SKILL.md`.

## Adding a rule

The full protocol is at the end of `SKILL.md`. In short:

1. One writer at a time. Parallel appends in separate copies diverge and have to be merged by hand.
2. A new rule is a `### slug` section at the end of the matching topic file, in the
   Principle / Symptom / Pattern format. No "verified on <file>" trailer — a reader outside your
   project can't use it, and it's where client names and node ids leak.
3. A new topic means a new file plus a row in the routing table, in the same commit.
4. Commit the pack change separately from the task that produced it — otherwise it gets forgotten.

Facts about one specific Figma file — Set IDs, Page IDs, local quirks — go into your own
`references/files/<file>.md`. They don't travel with this pack, and the pack ships none.
