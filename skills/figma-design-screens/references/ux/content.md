# Content — truncation, formats, typography of running text

Reached from `references/ux-rules.md`. Read when the screen shows real data: names, amounts, dates,
long strings, tables, paragraphs.

### Essential text is never truncated

Names, amounts, statuses, anything the row exists to communicate. Truncate the secondary line
instead. If every string in the row is essential and none fits, the layout is wrong — the text is
not the thing to fix.

**Read:** for each truncated node, whether the row would still make sense with that value hidden.
**Blocking:** an amount or an identity cut mid-word is a defect, not a compromise.

### Truncation is a decision made per node, not a fallback

Three outcomes, chosen deliberately: wrap to a second line, truncate with an ellipsis, or let the
container grow. And where a value is truncated, the full value has to be reachable somewhere — a
detail view, a tooltip, the next screen. For values whose *end* carries the meaning — file names,
identifiers, addresses — truncate the middle, not the tail.

**Read:** `textTruncation` / wrap behaviour is set explicitly on every text node that can overflow;
`ux-rules.md` routes to the mechanics in `figma-plugin-api-rules/references/text-and-styles.md`.

### Realistic content, not lorem ipsum and not "asdf"

Placeholder text hides exactly the problems the mockup exists to find: real names are longer, real
amounts have more digits, real statuses are two words. Fill the mockup with the plausible
worst case — the longest name, the largest number, the wordiest status — and the layout problems
surface before the build, not after.

**Look:** the longest string that will realistically occur is present somewhere on the screen.

### Numbers right, text left, one precision per column

In a table, digits line up only when the column is right-aligned; text scans only when it is
left-aligned. And a column keeps one format: `1,000` next to `1000.5` cannot be compared at a
glance, which is the entire purpose of putting them in a column.

**Read:** alignment per column type, and one decimal precision per numeric column.

### A date format that can be misread is a bug

`03/04` is March the fourth or the third of April depending on the reader. In a mockup either use a
format that cannot be misread (`4 Mar 2026`) or state the locale the screen assumes. Thousands
separators and decimal marks differ by locale too — a screen that hardcodes one is a screen that
will be wrong somewhere.

**Read:** every date on the screen is unambiguous, or `design.md` records the locale.

### An amount states its currency

A number with no symbol or code is a defect in any product that will ever have a second currency,
which is most of them. The same goes for units: 12 what?

**Read:** every amount carries a currency; every measurement carries a unit.

### Reading text sits between about 45 and 75 characters per line

Longer and the eye loses the return to the next line; much shorter and the rhythm breaks up. This
governs paragraph containers — not labels, not table cells.

**Read:** the paragraph container's width against the string's average character width.

### Line height belongs to the size, not to the file

Headings sit tighter, body text looser, and long lines need more than short ones. One line-height
value applied across every size — the usual outcome of a single spacing token — makes headings airy
and body text cramped at the same time.

**Read:** line-height values differ across the type scale rather than sharing one number.

### A heading that wraps to one orphan word reads as broken

Balance it or shorten it. A two-line heading whose second line holds a single short word looks like
a layout failure even when it is technically correct.

**Look:** every multi-line heading at its real width, with the real string.

### The type scale is a scale

`14 / 15 / 16` on one screen is drift, not hierarchy — nobody can perceive that difference as a
level, so it reads as inconsistency. Steps have to be big enough to be seen as steps.

**Read:** the distinct font sizes used on the screen, against the scale in the design system.
