# Setup: First Run In A Project

Reached from `SKILL.md` exactly once per project: the first time `<project>/.claude/design.md` doesn't exist. Every run after the first reads that file instead of following this one.

## Step 1 — Discover before asking

Before asking anything, look for a place where the project already keeps design knowledge. The two questions in Step 2 are asked only if this search comes up empty.

Search, in this order:

1. **Domain-specific design documents** in the project root or its docs folder — files like `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` or `<PRODUCT>_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.
2. **`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`** — project instructions often name a design system or house style directly.
3. **`DESIGN.md` / `PRODUCT.md`** or similar top-level docs.
4. **The Figma file itself** — variable collections and text styles are a design system even when no document describes them in words. Open the file and check before concluding there's nothing.
5. **Project memory**, if this agent keeps one for the project — a past session may already have recorded the answer.

**Rule: if the project already has a place for design knowledge, `design.md` points to it — it does not restate it.** Copying a style description into `design.md` creates a second copy that drifts the moment either one is edited alone. Record a pointer (file path, Figma file key, memory entry name) and stop there.

If the search finds something, skip Step 2 entirely. Write the pointer into `design.md` (format in `references/state.md`) and start working.

## Step 2 — The survey: exactly two questions

Ask only if Step 1 found nothing. No more than these two, in this order.

**Question 1 — Is there a design system?**

- **Yes** → the design system is law. Colors, typography, and components come from it; nothing is invented. Ask only *where* it's described (a document, a Figma file, or both) and record the pointer. Stop here — the phases below don't run.
- **No** → ask Question 2.

**Question 2 — (only if no design system) Are there existing screens in Figma?**

- **Yes** → those screens are the style to match. New work is built to match their style. External references are gathered only as an addition, and only when the task explicitly calls for a fresh direction.
- **No** → this is a from-scratch product. Go to "From scratch" below.

## Never ask

- **Interface language.** Not part of this survey, at any point, regardless of which answer the two questions above produce.
- **What medium the mockups are built in.** Always Figma. This skill doesn't cover any other medium, so there's nothing to choose.

Asking either turns a two-question survey into a longer interview, and the rest of the skill has no use for the answer.

## From scratch

Reached only when Question 2 was answered "no existing screens." Skipped entirely whenever a design system or existing screens were found.

Order matters — each phase gives the next one something to answer to, instead of a blank page:

1. **References.** The skill gathers external references itself, lays them out in a grid, and the user marks the ones that fit by clicking. The marked set is the input to every phase below.
2. **Three directions.** Synthesize three distinct directions from the marked references. Show them; the user picks or mixes.
3. **Typography, then palette.** Deliberately in this order, not the reverse: a font pairing carries more character than a color choice does, so settling type first gives the palette something concrete to answer to. In practice the answer to this step is often a mix rather than a single direction taken whole — a serif from one direction, a mono from another.
4. **Degree of character.** How far the product is willing to lean into the chosen direction — restrained or loud — in the user's own words.
5. **Patterns, in words.** Describe recurring layout and component patterns verbally, before touching Figma. This is the raw material that later becomes the signature-traits list in `design.md`.
6. **Screens.** Only now, build.

**Rule for every fork in this phase: the user may answer with a mix, not only pick one option.** Don't force a single choice where the honest answer spans two — the typography example above is what that looks like in practice.

## After the survey

Every answer — the pointer from Step 1, or the questionnaire and from-scratch results from Steps 2 and beyond — is written into `<project>/.claude/design.md` (format and upkeep rules: `references/state.md`). From the next run onward, this project doesn't repeat the survey; it reads the file.
